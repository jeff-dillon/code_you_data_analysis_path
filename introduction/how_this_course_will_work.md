### Introduction

The Code:You Data Analysis Path is an open-source community dedicated to 
providing the best information sources to take you from zero to a data analyst. 
More information can be found at the [Code:You about page](https://code-you.org/about/).

In this unit, we'll learn about the data analysis process and start thinking 
about the basics of data literacy.

Each of the following sections and lessons represents essential baseline 
knowledge. Even if you have no intention of becoming a data analyst yourself, 
this material should help you gain a useful understanding of the moving parts 
involved in discovering and analyzing data.

We will start by getting familiar with data and your own computer. Next, we’ll 
work on setting up a development environment and learning about Git and GitHub. 
Then, we’ll go over the basics of Python, Pandas, SQL, and Dashboards before 
stepping into a capstone project.

By the end of this pathway, you should not only understand how data works but 
also be able to identify and differentiate between all the technologies that you 
will use to build your own analysis project. You will be able to understand a 
simple dataset, clean it, perform analysis and build visualizations while 
working comfortably from the command line.

This pathway intentionally covers a very broad range of topics. It’s silly to 
go diving straight into complex data visualizations without having a context for 
what data analysis is and why it’s useful (and why you should learn it!).

### How it works

This curriculum works by pulling together the best content from across the 
internet for learning a particular topic. In each lesson, we’ll introduce the 
topic and try to provide some useful context before pointing you to external 
resources made by others.

Most lessons will contain questions that you should be able to answer before 
moving on. Some of the lessons will ask you to complete exercises. In addition, 
we provide several exercises throughout the curriculum to help you grow your 
understanding by actually building things.

Try not to think of the Data Analysis Pathway, or programming, as a class in 
school. It’s not material you learn all at once to take a test, and then pass 
or fail. You can think of it as a snowball. You, yourself, are a snowball. 
You’re rolling down a hill full of snow; the further you roll, the more snow 
will stick to you. Sure, snow will also fall off you, and you’ll forget things 
often, but that’s just part of the process. Don’t be scared if you get to a 
project and you feel like you haven’t retained or memorized anything. That’s 
natural and happens to everyone. The information will come back to you as you 
start solving your problems one at a time, relying on Google and the Coe:You 
community for help.

### What comes next

Once you’ve completed this pathway, you should feel comfortable with the building 
blocks of data analysis but itching to dig deeper. Though we spend a fair bit 
of time digging into each of the major topics in this course, it’s really just a 
taste of what comes next (and all the cool stuff you can do with it).

Additional resources are the only thing that is considered optional unless 
explicitly stated. These are here in case you feel like you need or want to 
dive deeper into a topic to get a better understanding.

**DO NOT SKIP ANYTHING!**

Good luck and have fun!
