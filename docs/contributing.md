# Welcome to the Code:You | Data Analysis Path contributing guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project. Any 
contribution you make will be reflected in the pathway curriculum.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from 
opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## New Contributor Guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](../README.md). Here are some resources to 
help you get started with open source contributions:

- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

## Getting Started

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the curriculum, search if an issue already exists. 
If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue.

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. You can narrow 
down the search using labels as filters. See Labels for more information. As a 
general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, 
you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

1. Fork the repo so you can make your changes without affecting the original 
project until you're ready to merge them.
1. Create a working branch and start your changes.

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

- Don't forget to link PR to issue if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to allow maintainer edits so the branch can be updated 
for a merge. Once you submit your PR, team member will review your proposal. We 
may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using 
suggested changes or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes 
directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then 
commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this 
[git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you 
resolve merge conflicts and other issues.


### Your PR is merged!

Congratulations ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ The Code:You team thanks you âœ¨.

Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible on the 
Code:You repo.
