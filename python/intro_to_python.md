lesson.

- What is Python?
- History of Python
- Pythonic Principles


### What is Python?

Python is a popular hig-level, general-purpose programming language that can be 
used for a wide variety of applications including building websites and software, 
automating tasks, and conducting data analysis. 

A **"general-purpose language"** means it can be used to create a variety 
of different programs and isn't specialized for any specific problems.

A **"high-level language"** means it is developer-friendly and generally 
independent of the "Ones and Zeros" used by the computer's hardware and software.


### History of Python

- Python was created by Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer, in the late 1980s.
- Early versions of Python (0.9.0 - 2.0) showcased Python's core features, 
including exception handling, functions, and modules.
- Python 3.0, also known as "Python 3000" or "Py3k," was a major overhaul of 
the language. It aimed to address various design flaws and inconsistencies in 
Python 2 while maintaining backward compatibility. Python 3.0 is not backward 
compatible with Python 2.
- Any modern version of Python (version 3.9 or greater) will work for this course.


### Pythonic Principles

Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability.

Pythonic is the word describing writing code that doesn't just get the syntax 
right, but uses the language the way it is intended to be used.

Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) specify Python features and document 
design decisions. There are hundreds of PEPs, but it is worthwhile to review 
two in particular:

**[PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)** defines the Python Style Guide - 
or put simply - coding conventions you should use when writing Python programs.

**[PEP 20](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/)** defines the "Zen of Python", 
or the guiding principles for Python's design. 

```
- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- Flat is better than nested.
- Sparse is better than dense.
- Readability counts.
- Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
- Although practicality beats purity.
- Errors should never pass silently.
- Unless explicitly silenced.
- In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
- There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
- Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
- Now is better than never.
- Although never is often better than *right* now.
- If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
- If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
- Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!```
```

If you are brand new to programming, these principles won't make a lot of 
sense yet. At a high level, you can focus on the idea of writing simple, easily 
understood code. Think of writing code as writing for other people to read the 
code as much as writing for the computer to run the code.


### Summary

Python's journey from its creation by Guido van Rossum to its current state as 
one of the most popular and widely used programming languages demonstrates its 
adaptability and commitment to improvement. The ongoing development of Python 
ensures that it remains a relevant and powerful language for a wide variety of 
applications.
