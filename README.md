# Code You: Data Analysis Path

**The Code You: Data Analysis Path** is an open source data analysis curriculum. 
Not everyone has access to a computer science education or the funds to attend 
an intensive coding school and neither of those is right for everyone anyway. 

This project is designed to be used as the curriculum for the 
[Code:You](https://code-you.org/) Data Analysis Path in conjuntion with weekly 
mentoring sessions and career development resources. 

[Code:You](https://code-you.org/) is a family of programs consisting of Code 
Louisville, Code Kentucky, and emPOWER UP. All our programs are driven by one 
purpose: to build a safe and inclusive learning community where anyone can have 
access to the resources needed to develop a rewarding career in the world of 
technology. All at no cost to you!

The structure and content in this course is based heavily on 
[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Foundations course. Some of
the originl content from The Odin Project has been adapted to the Data Analysis 
topic.

## Data Analysis Foundations

This is where it all begins! A hands-on introduction the the essential tools
you'll need to build real, working data analysis projects. You'll learn what
Data Analysts actually do - the foundations for later courses.
